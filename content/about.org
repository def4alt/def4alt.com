In 2022 I finished Ukrainian school, which specializes in Physics and Mathematics.

While studying in school, I've always tried to deepen my knowledge of programming. At first, I tried to make my own game engine in C# when I was 14. My older brother eventually noticed this and thankfully stopped me from this heresy. Then, I learned what Haskell was when I was 16. For a teenager who only knew what OOP was, it was mind-blowing. After that, I tried to learn graphics programming. I learned what OpenGL and Vulkan are and made triangles by following the tutorials. When I was 17, I had a lot of concepts for projects, which eventually stuck in development hell, such as my own adventure game. I even made a plot for the game. However, the development never went further than basic mechanics in Unity, Unreal Engine, Bevy, or any other game engine I have ever tried. From time to time, I try to return to the ideas, and eventually, I believe something will come out.

I watch conferences, such as [[https://ndcconferences.com/][NDC]], [[https://gdconf.com/][GDC]], [[https://gotopia.tech/][GOTO Meetups]], etc., to gain motivation and best practices to program better. So far, I'm writing this text in DOOM Emacs distribution with Rust, Typescript, Org, C++, and LaTeX plugins enabled. At home, I have set up Fedora Linux, but right now, due to the Russian-Ukrainian war, I have no access to it.

However, I don't forget about my social life too. As a child, I enjoyed going to the camps, particularly "Kashtan," which merch bracelet I wear even now. I play guitar and spend time with my friends. Sometimes, I can write some essays about different topics and provide some new ideas. Also, I really like to chat with boys and girls about deep thoughts. Overall, I like to analyze myself and the people surrounding me. It just gives me some sort of confidence?

Right now, I am a young lad motivated to study CS and willing to continue to improve in all the fields he can and want.
