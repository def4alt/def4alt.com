For every person, happiness is the most pleasant thing. It is this pleasure that distinguishes a person from others, and each person is unique in terms of a set of these pleasures. Hryhorii Skovoroda believed that a person will find happiness only after knowing God, knowing himself, and then "related work". Everyone agrees with this statement.

Skovoroda believed that a person has a hell and heaven, which are constantly opposed to each other, and only a person chooses who will win. "And no one can kill the evil in himself if he does not first find out what is evil and what is good...", he reasoned. I have a slightly different opinion: I believe that hell and heaven are inseparable components of the mind. They are not hostile, but on the contrary, they are trying to meet. But if a person buries some part in the universe of shadows, the person ceases to be alive. That is, if a person builds a bridge between Reality and Fantasy on a very fragile part of his mind and does not break it, he will find his happiness. Most have three phases of the bridge: there is a bridge, then it is gone, and then it is there again. It's always a shame that a bridge collapses because it takes a lot of calcium and dendrites to rebuild it.

Hryhorii Skovoroda taught people the geocentric system of the organism's universe, that is, the heart is the place where the great boom of the spiritual upheaval took place. It was there that the spiritual engine started working for the first time. He said: "A nut without a kernel is nothing, just like a person without a heart." This is not surprising, because Hryhorii was from the Baroque era, which was the successor of the Renaissance era, where these ideas lived. But we - "homo sapiens" from the twenty-first century know that the heart is not responsible for the spiritual world, this work is performed by the brain. It is in these curls that our hell and heaven are born. That's it, science has destroyed perhaps the most romantic theory of the Skovoroda universe.

But what is "related work"? "Is the one who, starting a long journey, does not keep his measure during the journey wise?" - this is exactly how our geocentric thought. In his opinion, the easiest and most pleasant work is "relative". And the difficult one and, in your opinion, unnecessary, should be bypassed. This is a really interesting and good philosophy, as for me - a schoolboy. But in fact, it is very difficult for me to define the concept of "related work" in general. Maybe this is the peak of the "What is happiness" chain, which is unique for everyone, or maybe there are higher mountains than Everest.

So, for every person, happiness is something most pleasant. It is this pleasure that distinguishes a person from others, and each person is unique in terms of a set of these pleasures. Hryhorii Skovoroda believed that happiness is the peak of Everest, a romantic system of the universe of man and the bridge between hell and paradise, which is constantly being destroyed. Everyone agrees with this statement.
